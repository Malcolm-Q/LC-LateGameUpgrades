TODO for 3.0.0

Contracts  
Beaded Bag type item  
Fire Mixtape upgrade  

## Contracts
Contracts will target a random free moon and provide a tough objective that if completed provides a good reward.

Exterminator Contract
* spawn a bunch of hoarding bugs right away
* make them more aggressive
* you have to find and destroy a nest object
Data Contract
* Spawn a pc object
* you have to find and complete a minigame
* get a valuable disk
Extraction Contract
* Spawn a heavy, noisy playermodel
* you have to find and retrieve it
* Could use a bunch of different models (peter griffin etc)


## Fire Mixtape Upgrade
Upgrades the boombox so players within radius of an active boombox get a speed boost and maybe damage boost and stuff

## Beaded Bag
A bag that players can go inside of and put scrap inside of

Basically just instantiate a room prefab under the dungeon each moon and teleport players into it on interact.
