- After being done with your implementation and wish to merge it with the mod, you can make a [pull request](https://github.com/Malcolm-Q/LC-LateGameUpgrades/pulls) which then I would review it and either see it's all good to merge it with the mod or make questions/suggestions about it to understand better what are you trying to include to the mod.

<summary> Models </summary>
<br>

- I am not that good at making a decent model for items so having people that don't mind making models to be used in this mod is always welcome.
- If your model is indeed used, credit will be given in the mod's [README](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/malco/Lategame_Upgrades/).
