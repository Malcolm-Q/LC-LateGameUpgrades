***INSTALL THE DEPENDENCIES***  
***ALL CLIENTS NEED THIS MOD INSTALLED***  
to install just put the MoreShipUpgrades folder in your BepInEx plugins folder.

### *Everything about this mod can be changed via the extremely extensive config "com.malco.lethalcompany.moreshipupgrades.config"*  
The config is automatically synced from host to clients excluding changes to equipment (peeper, night vision goggles, portable teles)


Type `lategame` in the terminal to see mod info!  
Type `lategame store` or `lgu` to view current upgrade status and cost.  
Type `info <upgrade>` for dynamic info.

This adds:
* 20+ Upgrades.
* 5 complex team oriented missions (Contracts).
* Mission items, NPC, rewards and behaviours.
* 8 new Store items.
* 1 rare scrap (Shopping cart).
   
The goal of this mod is to allow you to make playthroughs last longer and to remedy the stale lategame of not having anything to spend your money on and only going to one moon.

If using V40 - downgrade to V2.1.0  
If using v45 - downgrade to v2.8.6

## Compatibility

### This mod changes and patches a lot so problems may arise.  
- Bigger Lobby and More Company are more or less compatible but credit desync can arise  
- Use common sense, EX: if you download a mod that changes the movement speed of the player every frame and the movement speed upgrade from my mod doesn't work that's why.

## Upgrade Store Interface
``lgu`` prompts an interactive user interface in which you can select the upgrade you wish to upgrade or to simply check what it does through its displayed information.
You can check the key binds used for More Ship Upgrades to understand how to navigate through the interface (and customize to your liking)
