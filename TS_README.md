## Item Progression Mode

This mod offers an alternative mode for obtaining upgrades through selling items to The Company. The following modes are available for playthroughs:
* Apparatice
    * Items that are considered an "apparatus" (configurable due to custom interiors having custom items) will provide a randomly picked upgrade to level up when sold to The Company
* Chance per Scrap
    * When any kind of scrap item is sold to The Company, a roll will be made and check if it meets the chance criteria (value is configurable).
    * If successfull, an upgrade will be picked to level up according to the selected chance mode:
        * Random: an upgrade will be picked at random without any outside factors influencing the choice.
        * Cheapest: the upgrade that has the lowest cost to purchase will be picked
        * Lowest Level: the upgrade that has the lowest level will be picked

* Nearest Value
    * On each quota met event, the value accquired to meet the quota will be used to pick an upgrade that has at least the same cost
    for the quota value.
    * If no upgrades were found that had a cost lower than the meeting quota, no upgrade is picked.

* Unique Scrap
    * Upon save boot, each scrap item will be associated to an upgrade at random.
    When the item is sold, percentage of that amount (configurable) is used to contribute to the costs of the respective upgrade.
    Once the amount contributed to the item has been reached, the upgrade will rank up to the next level (if allowed).

* Custom Scrap
    * Similar logic with "Unique Scrap" but the items assigned to each upgrade are the ones assigned in each upgrade's configuration.
    * The names inserted in this configuration can be either the names displayed in their scan nodes or their internal names (in this case, the value of "itemProperties.itemName)
        * The names are case insensitive

## Randomize Upgrades Mode

This mod offers a "Randomize Upgrade" mode where a set amount of upgrades are picked from the total enabled and then shown in the upgrade store.
* You can configure the amount of upgrades that can be picked randomly to appear in the store
* You can configure this mode to allow showing already purchased upgrades.
* You can configure when should the randomization of the upgrades be executed (per moon landing, per moon routing or per quota).

## Contracts
* __Defusal Contract__
    * Look around the facility for a ticking bomb. Defuse it before the timer runs out or anyone near it might meet a gruesome fate.
    * A serial is shown on it. You will need this for the command ``lookup <serial>`` in the terminal which it will show the right sequence of wires you need to cut to defuse it.

* __Data Contract__
    * An old laptop has been found inside the facility with valuable data. Find it and retrieve the disk contained within.
    * Upon first interaction, an IP is displayed that needs to be inputted in the command ``bruteforce <IP>`` in the terminal.
    * This will show the user credentials used to log in into the laptop.
    * Upon logging in, a command line screen is displayed. Players will need to navigate through the screen through the commands:
        *  ``ls`` (list all files in current directory/folder)
        *  ``cd <folder>`` (move into selected folder)
        *  ``cd ..`` (move back to parent/previous folder)
        * ``mv survey.db`` (retrieve the requested file when present in current directory)

* __Exterminator Contract__
    * A nest of hoarding bugs has been detected on this facility. Clear them out and destroy the nest.
    * It's this simple: look for the nest while avoiding the monsters within and destroy it. A loot object will spawn after destroying it.

* __Exorcism Contract__
    * A ritual site has been detected in the facility. Look for the site and stop the ritual by using the correct items scattered around.
    * A pentagram will spawn around the facility that you will need to find. It makes a sound to tell that it's nearby.
    * Upon being found, you can look at the altar and find which demon the altar belongs to. You will need this information for the terminal command ``demon <demonName>``.
    * It will show the list of required items you need to put into the altar to stop the ritual. Any wrong item put in the altar will attract unwanted visitors.
    * Upon inserting the right items, a loot item will spawn to which you can carry to the ship.

* __Extraction Contract__
    * A fellow employee has been reported missing in the facility. You will need to find him and escort them back to the ship for safety (and disciplinary action by The Company)
    * They will be laying on the floor pleading for help. You can tell when they are nearby through their shouts.
    * You will also find several medkits found in the facility. You will need one as the scavenger appears to have hurt themselves and cannot get back up on their feet.
    * After helping the employee, you will have to carry them out of the facility. They are really heavy and will start making alot of noise when sensing any nearby danger.
    * After being escorted back to the ship, they will thank you for your help non-stop til you arrive at The Company (where you escort them for disciplinary action).

## Commands
* ``contracts``
    * Brings out an interactive UI where you can select to obtain a contract, see current contract status and information related to each contract type.

## API
* Hunter
    * You can register your own items to the Hunter upgrade for them to spawn on enemy kills! Just follow the wiki page associated with ``Hunter API``.
